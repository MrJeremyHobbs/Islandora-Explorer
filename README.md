# IslandoraExplorer

IslandoraExplorer is a script to display Islandora content on large TV monitors.

It performs a SOLR search against your Islandora repository, gets a result, downloads the archival image, and embeds the description/caption of the archival photograph in the EXIF data of the saved image.

Using [FastStone Viewer](https://www.faststone.org/download.htm), a freeware image slideshow program, these images can then be displayed on a large jumbotron or projects onto a screen.
